### Bayesian layers and utilities to perform stochastic variational inference in PyTorch

Bayesian-Torch is a library of neural network layers and utilities extending the core of PyTorch to enable the user to perform stochastic variational inference in Bayesian deep neural networks.
Bayesian-Torch is designed to be flexible and seamless in extending a deterministic deep neural network architecture to corresponding Bayesian form by simply replacing the deterministic layers with Bayesian layers. 


The repository has implementations for the following Bayesian layers:

## Installation


**Install from source:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/IntelLabs/bayesian-torch
cd bayesian-torch
pip install .
```
This code has been tested on PyTorch v1.8.1 LTS.

Dependencies:

- Create conda environment with python=3.7
- Install PyTorch and torchvision packages within conda environment following instructions from [PyTorch install guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- conda install -c conda-forge accimage
- pip install tensorboard
- pip install scikit-learn

## Example usage
We have provided [example model implementations](bayesian_torch/models/bayesian) using the Bayesian layers.

We also provide [example usages](bayesian_torch/examples) and [scripts](bayesian_torch/scripts) to train/evaluate the models. The instructions for CIFAR10 examples is provided below, similar scripts for ImageNet and MNIST are available.

```
cd bayesian_torch
```

### Training

To train Bayesian ResNet on CIFAR10, run this command:

**Mean-field variational inference (Reparameterized Monte Carlo estimator)**
```train
sh scripts/train_bayesian_cifar.sh
```
